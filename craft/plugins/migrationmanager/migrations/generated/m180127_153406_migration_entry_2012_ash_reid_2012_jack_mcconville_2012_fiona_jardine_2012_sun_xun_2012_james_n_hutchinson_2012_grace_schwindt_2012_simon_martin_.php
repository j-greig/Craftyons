The idea of the faux-luxurious interior of the spa that acts ostensibly outside of society\u0027s remit, was examined as a non-site wherein the individual can propagate actions of self negation and debasement.

The film considers the chair\u0027s contemporary afterlife in the form of Philippe Starck\u0027s updated \u0027Louis Ghost Chair\u0027. From antique period-piece to modern-day style accessory, the chair\u0027s transition from wood to plastic, from artisan workshop to high-tech assembly line is illuminated with commentary by a female actor.</p><p>Simon Martin\u2019s practice examines the cultural significance of art and artefacts and our relationship to them, and encompasses painting, sculpture and moving image.  To this end, Simon displayed a new body of photographic works alongside <em>Louis Ghost Chair</em>. The works created specifically for Collective featured a series of African headrests selected from the photographic archive of National Museums Scotland\u2019s ethnographic collection. These photographic works further illuminate issues of the representation and framing of objects developed in the film work. </p><hr /><h4>Events</h4><p><em>Simon Martin in conversation with Kate Gray</em>, 30 June 2012<br />Simon Martin discussed his new film work <em>Louis Ghost Chair</em>, and the two new photographic commissions shown alongside it at Collective, with Collective\u0027s Director Kate Gray.

The exhibition title is derived from British novelist B.S. Johnson\u0027s idea that narrative fiction is a form of \u0027lying\u0027 and the show explores the conflict between storytelling and formal experimentation by mixing different sculptural and architectural idioms.

Collective has a role of developing new talent in the visual arts in Scotland and internationally; Mick Peter exemplifies this process. Mick was first selected for New Work Scotland Programme in 2000, its inaugural year. Since that time Mick went on to exhibit internationally and was included in the British Art Show 7 in 2010. Collective took this opportunity to present Mick\u2019s work to an international audience during Edinburgh Art Festival 2012 as a chance to reflect upon the organisation\u2019s activities over the last 12 years as it prepared for further developments. </p><hr /><h4>Events</h4><p><em>Lying and Liars on Film</em>, 3 August 2012<br />The Filmhouse, Edinburgh.<br />A range of novelist B.S.

Artist Mick Peter and writer and curator Steven Cairns programmed this screening, which coincides with Peter\u2019s new exhibition at Collective that also features Johnson\u0027s 1969 film <em>Paradigm</em>.
